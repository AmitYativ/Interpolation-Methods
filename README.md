# Interpolation-Methods

This simple program utilizes interpolation methods, such as Spline Interpolation, Lagrange Interpolation, and Neville's Algorithm, to calculate Specific Heat of temperature nodes of a substance, and compares the approximations to measured data. Datasets can be added or changed as necessary.
